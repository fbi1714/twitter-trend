## Overview

  The Top Topics was our group project and it aimed to get the top Twitter trending topics from the five biggest cities in Australia.  It was my first application to be deployed on Heroku and my first time working with a team. For this project, I was in charge to create a responsive sidebar to load the top tweets for the 5th biggest Australian cities using the Backbone.js library. Moreover, I was in charge to deploy the application online to Heroku and to manage the project repository.
