## Overview

  The Top Topics was our group project and it aimed to get the top Twitter trending topics from the five biggest cities in Australia.  It was my first application to be deployed on Heroku and my first time working with a team. For this project, I was in charge to create a responsive sidebar to load the top tweets for the 5th biggest Australian cities using the Backbone.js library. Moreover, I was in charge to deploy the application online to Heroku and to manage the project repository.

## Explanations

  1. Technologies used in this project:
      1. Ruby on Rails as web framework
      2. Postgress as SQL database for the local development enviroment
      3. Heroku was service provide to run the application online/in-the-cloud.
      4. [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com/) as CSS library
      5. jQuery to render some effects from the Materializecss and the [Fixer.io](http://fixer.io) api.
      6. [Fixer.io](http://fixer.io) api to get the currency data
      7. [Wolfram Alpha data api](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/) to get the cities world time
      8. The Ruby on Rails [will_paginate gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/will_paginate) to generates the order tables pagination.


  2. Issues:    

    - Enable the order table to be filtered, sorted and searched.
    - Improve the currency exchange area and the time area designs.
    - Heroku issue with the Robot font. It doesn't find the font due an issue with the Ruby on Rails environments see [here](http://blog.silvabox.com/materialize-on-rails-4-with-bower-and-heroku/) a long topic about this type of problem
    - Only enable the apis data to be rendered after the user have logged in
